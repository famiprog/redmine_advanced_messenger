  disable_fix_for_scroll_to_anchor_note: >
   Context: this plugin enriches via JS the pages that are generated by Redmine. We took this approach to avoid copying/pasting/modifying the original Redmine code. One disadvantage is that when "scroll to anchor" (e.g. click on a note), if there are a lot of notes => the scroll may not be precise.<br/><br/>
   The fix: we fixed this by enriching partially the content on the server side, after generation. We use regexes for this. In theory we should be future proof. But there is a small chance that newer Redmine versions modify the page structure => our regexes 1/ don't work any more and/or 2/ cause a perf impact.<br/><br/>
   If you feel that this is happening, try to disable the fix. This will come at the cost of imprecise "scroll to anchor".
  notification_mail_content: Notification mail content
  notification_mail_content_description: W/ "Teaser" (which is the default), the notification email doesn't contain the note text, but only a small teaser text inviting to open the note in Redmine. This forces the receiver to read in Redmine, and thus mark as read. Otherwise the receiver might read from the email, w/o the motivation to go in Redmine and mark as read.
  teaser: Teaser
  whole_note: Whole note
  select_roles_to_exclude: Select roles to exclude from email notifications
  select_roles_to_exclude_note: >
   People that have installed and use the PWA will probably use this feature. They are notified by the app, in the taskbar. So receiving emails is redundant and pollutes the mailbox. Note: this applies only for messages intercepted by %{title}. Not all the email messages.
